     <h1> I attempted to answer a question to better understand how traffic violations are impacted by differenct factors, such as the race of an individual. I think the answer is yes and no. No because lots of cops only look at cars to see if they're driving badly and they don't really look at the person who's driving. Whereas the answer could also be yes because there's other cops that look at the people driving the cars. If they see a colored person driving they tend to look more closely at those cars to spot any mistakes.</h1>
